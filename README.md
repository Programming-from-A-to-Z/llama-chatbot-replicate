### Prompt Formatting and System Prompts

When prompting Llama, user inputs are wrapped with `[INST]` and `[/INST]` tags to signal the beginning and end of user input. This formatting helps Llama distinguish between its responses and user messages.

System prompts are used to guide or constrain the model's behavior.
